## 0.3.0 (2026-10-27)

### Breaking Changes

#### Release a coherent runtime API compatibility boundary

Adopt explicit shared-read/exclusive/coordinator scheduling, typed custom-provider
capabilities, and owned worktree metadata. Rust integrators must update
ToolExecutor implementations to execution_mode and initialize the new public
configuration and ownership fields.

Release the shared API's reverse dependency closure together so older consumers
cannot resolve patch-compatible packages that expose incompatible API types.
The CLI package also exports a Rust library, so its compatibility release is
0.4.0. Existing command-line use remains supported.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-26)

### Breaking Changes

#### Release the Responses loop and Codex patch parity improvements as Roder 0.2, including dependent crates built against the new shared API. Isolate config-dependent tests from process environment and saved authentication. Update shell-include coverage to the current Plan process policy.

Breaking change: apply_patch accepts only the canonical patch argument and Codex patch syntax. Crate consumers must rebuild against the new shared API versions.

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-16)

### Features

#### Fireworks AI inference provider

Add the first-party `fireworks` inference provider with account-scoped model ids, Fireworks-specific API-key configuration, OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, offline model metadata, model discovery, and app-server provider-list coverage.
