## 0.2.0 (2026-09-26)

### Breaking Changes

#### Release the Responses loop and Codex patch parity improvements as Roder 0.2, including dependent crates built against the new shared API. Isolate config-dependent tests from process environment and saved authentication. Update shell-include coverage to the current Plan process policy.

Breaking change: apply_patch accepts only the canonical patch argument and Codex patch syntax. Crate consumers must rebuild against the new shared API versions.

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-16)

### Features

#### Fireworks AI inference provider

Add the first-party `fireworks` inference provider with account-scoped model ids, Fireworks-specific API-key configuration, OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, offline model metadata, model discovery, and app-server provider-list coverage.
