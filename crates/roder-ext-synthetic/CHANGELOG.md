### Fixes

#### Manage external web-search providers from the TUI

Extend the "Web search provider" settings submenu to list the external provider
router options (firecrawl, tavily, perplexity, parallel, synthetic) alongside
the hosted modes, showing each provider's enabled and API-key-configured status
and the active selection. Selecting an external provider persists
`[web_search] mode = "external"`, the chosen `provider`, and enables that
provider's sub-section in user config (applies on restart).

The same hosted modes and external providers are also selectable from the
`Ctrl+P` command palette, and both the menu and palette fall back to reading
providers directly from user config when app-server settings are unavailable.

`settings/get` and `settings/set_web_search` now report the external-router
snapshot via `WebSearchSettings { external_enabled, external_provider, providers }`
and accept an optional `external_provider` selection. New `roder-config`
helpers (`save_web_search_external_provider`, `WebSearchConfig::provider_configured`,
`WebSearchConfig::router_snapshot`, `web_search_router_snapshot`) back the
persistence, status checks, and config-only fallback.

Synthetic web search now auto-configures from the synthetic inference provider:
because both share `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`, pasting the synthetic provider key
(`providers/configure`) makes the synthetic search provider report as
`key configured`, enables its `[web_search.synthetic]` sub-section, and lets it
resolve the borrowed key at runtime — no separate web-search key entry needed.

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-22)

### Features

#### Add first-party Synthetic inference provider

Adds the `synthetic` provider using Synthetic's OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions API. The provider ships built-in `syn:` model aliases
(`syn:large:text` default, plus `syn:small:text`, `syn:large:vision`,
`syn:small:vision`), preserves concrete `hf:{owner}/{model}` ids across config,
discovery, and selection, and resolves credentials only from
`SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`/`RODER_SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` or `[providers.synthetic]`. The
provider is visible without credentials so app-server and TUI can show setup
state, and turn-time inference fails locally with setup guidance when the key
is missing. The TUI provider menu points to the Synthetic dashboard for API-key
setup instead of the generic fallback URL.

### Fixes

#### Show full provider error response body in the timeline detail popup

Chat Completions provider errors (e.g. Synthetic 502 Bad Gateway) previously
discarded the response body entirely and showed only a generic hint like
"provider server error; response body redacted". Now the error includes the
full response body after a separator, so clicking the error row (or pressing
Enter on it) opens the existing tool-detail popup with the complete provider
response text — the same popup used for shell output and file edits.

The auth credential (bearer token or api-key header value) is scrubbed from
the body before it enters the error message, so the popup is safe to share.
Bodies are capped at 4 KB to avoid unbounded error messages.

The TUI also makes `Error` timeline items selectable and clickable, routes
Enter on a selected error row to the detail modal, and renders the popup with
an "error details" title and "Response body" label when the source is a
provider error rather than a shell command.
