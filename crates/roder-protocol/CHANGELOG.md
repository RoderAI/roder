## 0.1.5 (2026-06-26)

### Features

#### Per-thread agent-swarm mode

Scope agent-swarm mode to a single thread instead of the whole runtime (roadmap
104 follow-up), so toggling swarm mode on one thread no longer leaks the swarm
reminder into other threads sharing the runtime — aligning swarm mode with the
per-thread `thread/*` contract.

The runtime keeps a per-thread override map alongside the global default
(mirroring the team per-member policy-mode idiom): `set_agent_swarm_mode_for_thread`
stores the override and emits `AgentSwarmModeChanged` with the real `thread_id`,
and `effective_agent_swarm_mode_for_thread` resolves the per-thread override or
falls back to the runtime-global default; the turn loop now consults it. The
`thread/set_agent_swarm_mode` app-server method gains an optional `threadId`
(present -> per-thread, absent -> global, preserving legacy behavior) echoed back
in the result, and the TUI passes its current thread id. `settings/get` continues
to expose the global default. Covered by runtime unit tests (per-thread
isolation, off-override-wins, real-thread-id event) and an app-server e2e test.

## 0.1.4 (2026-06-26)

### Features

#### Server-side agent-swarm mode

Move agent-swarm mode from TUI-only client state to runtime/app-server state so
every client benefits (roadmap 104). Adds the `thread/set_agent_swarm_mode`
app-server method, an `agentSwarmMode` field on `settings/get`, and an
`AgentSwarmModeChanged` event. When swarm mode is active the runtime injects the
canonical swarm reminder into each turn's developer instructions
(`Runtime::set_agent_swarm_mode` + `apply_agent_swarm_mode`), so the model is
nudged toward the `agent_swarm` fanout tool regardless of which client drove the
turn. The TUI now toggles swarm mode through the method and no longer prepends
the reminder client-side. Also fixes two pre-existing method-manifest ordering
issues (`auth/kimi-code/*`, `thread/compact`).

#### Per-thread MCP bearer token

Let a remote client scope a thread's MCP tool calls to a specific identity (for
Vex: a per-user, per-organization capability token). The client forwards the
token via a new `mcpAuthToken` field on `thread/start`; the app-server records
it in an in-memory `roder_api::mcp_auth` registry keyed by thread id, and the
MCP tool extension reads it during execution to authenticate that thread's tool
calls (falling back to the process default when absent). Tokens are short-lived
and re-supplied on each `thread/start`.

## 0.1.3 (2026-06-24)

### Features

#### Manage external web-search providers from the TUI

Extend the "Web search provider" settings submenu to list the external provider
router options (firecrawl, tavily, perplexity, parallel, synthetic) alongside
the hosted modes, showing each provider's enabled and API-key-configured status
and the active selection. Selecting an external provider persists
`[web_search] mode = "external"`, the chosen `provider`, and enables that
provider's sub-section in user config (applies on restart).

The same hosted modes and external providers are also selectable from the
`Ctrl+P` command palette, and both the menu and palette fall back to reading
providers directly from user config when app-server settings are unavailable.

`settings/get` and `settings/set_web_search` now report the external-router
snapshot via `WebSearchSettings { external_enabled, external_provider, providers }`
and accept an optional `external_provider` selection. New `roder-config`
helpers (`save_web_search_external_provider`, `WebSearchConfig::provider_configured`,
`WebSearchConfig::router_snapshot`, `web_search_router_snapshot`) back the
persistence, status checks, and config-only fallback.

Synthetic web search now auto-configures from the synthetic inference provider:
because both share `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`, pasting the synthetic provider key
(`providers/configure`) makes the synthetic search provider report as
`key configured`, enables its `[web_search.synthetic]` sub-section, and lets it
resolve the borrowed key at runtime — no separate web-search key entry needed.

## 0.1.2 (2026-06-16)

### Fixes

- Improve context compaction across phases 2–4: prune old tool outputs before full compaction, add LLM state-snapshot summarization with verify/reject, hysteresis coalescing, `/compact` via `thread/compact`, `context.compaction_skipped` metrics, and a Grok-style loop regression fixture. Phase 1 fixes remain: compaction boundary on load, once-per-turn guard, ProviderMetadata exclusion from token estimates, and suffix retention from the last user message.

#### Added first-class `kimi-code` (aliases: `kimi`, `moonshot`) inference provider and `roder-ext-kimi-code` crate.

- Kimi Code subscription OAuth uses the managed API (`api.kimi.com/coding/v1`) with Kimi device headers and `kimi-code-cli` User-Agent; API keys still use Moonshot Open Platform (`api.moonshot.ai/v1`).
- Catalog entry + `kimi-for-coding` model (K2.7 Code).
- Device OAuth against `auth.kimi.com` with `roder auth login kimi-code`, TUI/app-server `auth/kimi-code/*`, and token storage under `~/.roder/auth/kimi-code.json`.
- API key fallback via env/config (`KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`, `RODER_KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`).
- Registered via extension host (always available, like SuperGrok).
- Docs: `docs/roder-kimi-code-provider.md`.
- Live smoke test added (opt-in via `RODER_KIMI_CODE_LIVE=1`).

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-15)

### Features

#### First-party image generation providers (OpenAI GPT Image and Google Gemini Nano Banana)

Provider-neutral image generation through the core media API: an image-capable
`MediaGenerationRequest`/multi-output `MediaGenerationResponse` contract, a new
`ProvidedService::MediaGenerator` extension service, a runtime media generation
service backing the canonical `media_generate_image` tool with a deterministic
offline fallback, new `roder-ext-openai-images` (`gpt-image-2` plus legacy ids)
and `roder-ext-google-images` (Nano Banana 2/Pro/base) provider crates,
`[media.image_generation]` config, `media/image/providers/list` and
`media/image/generate` app-server methods, `roder media` CLI commands, palette
entries, and regenerated schemas/SDK stubs. Live provider smokes stay opt-in
behind `RODER_OPENAI_IMAGE_LIVE` / `RODER_GEMINI_IMAGE_LIVE`.

#### One-command Roder package install (`roder install npm:/git:/path`)

Roder packages bundle process extensions, skills, slash commands, and themes
behind a root `roder.toml` manifest. Install from npm, git (shorthand, SSH,
raw URLs, pinned refs), or local paths; manage with `roder packages
list|resources|enable|disable|approve|filter|sync|init`, `roder remove`,
`roder update`, and ephemeral `-e` loading. Resources surface through the
existing skills/commands/theme registries; the process-extension protocol
gains manifest-declared tool providers served over `tools/call`. New
app-server `packages/*` methods, a `/packages` builtin, and a Packages
palette section round out the surfaces. npm lifecycle scripts stay disabled
unless `--allow-scripts` is passed, and package process extensions never
launch before explicit approval.

### Fixes

#### Package-specific registry READMEs

Add package-specific README files for every Cargo crate, ensure npm and PyPI package READMEs link to roder.sh, and tighten the registry README verifier to require package-local documentation.

#### Registry README metadata and publish checklists

Ensure Cargo crates inherit the workspace README, document npm and PyPI publishing steps in package READMEs, and add a registry README verifier for future publishes.
