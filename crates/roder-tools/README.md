# roder-tools

`roder-tools` is the built-in tool support for [Roder](https://roder.sh).

## What It Does

It implements shared Roder tools such as search and package-visible tool definitions used by runtime extensions.

## How It Fits Into Roder

Roder is an agentic software development system with a Rust CLI/TUI, a JSON-RPC app-server, SDKs, package resources, and first-party runtime extensions. This package is released as part of that workspace so downstream users can depend on the same component boundaries that Roder itself uses.
