#### Per-turn OpenAI service tier (Fast mode), and GPT-6 Sol and Luna

A caller can now choose the OpenAI service tier for a turn.
`StartTurnRequest::service_tier_override` (for example `"priority"` for Fast
mode) is carried to every inference round of the turn as
`RuntimeHints::service_tier`. The OpenAI Responses provider sends it as the
top-level `service_tier` request field only on the OpenAI profile; OpenRouter,
xAI, and Fireworks never receive it. `None` keeps the provider default.

The tier OpenAI reports it actually served (`response.service_tier`) is recorded
on `TokenUsage::service_tier`, so a biller can tell a request that ran fast from
one that was downgraded to `"default"` under load. Both new fields are optional
and default to absent when older payloads are deserialized.

`StartTurnRequest` gains a public field, so code that builds it with a struct
literal must add `service_tier_override: None`.

The OpenAI/Codex catalog adds `gpt-6-sol` (efforts `low` through `max`, like
`gpt-6-astra`) and `gpt-6-luna` (efforts `low` through `max`, like
`gpt-5.6-luna`), so per-turn reasoning validation accepts them.

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-15)

### Fixes

#### Package-specific registry READMEs

Add package-specific README files for every Cargo crate, ensure npm and PyPI package READMEs link to roder.sh, and tighten the registry README verifier to require package-local documentation.

#### Registry README metadata and publish checklists

Ensure Cargo crates inherit the workspace README, document npm and PyPI publishing steps in package READMEs, and add a registry README verifier for future publishes.
