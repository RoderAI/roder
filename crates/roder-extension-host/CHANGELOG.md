## 0.1.10 (2026-07-23)

### Fixes

#### Parallel search + extract web tools

Fix Parallel.ai Search against the current V1 API (`advanced_settings` for
max_results/domain filters), add `parallel_extract` for URL markdown extraction,
auto-install Parallel tools when it is the selected web_search provider, and
inject short Parallel web-access instructions into the developer prompt when
those tools are available.

## 0.1.9 (2026-07-23)

### Features

#### Add DeepSeek Platform inference provider

Adds first-class `deepseek` provider support labeled "DeepSeek Platform", using
DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API at `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`
with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` auth and built-in models `deepseek-chat`,
`deepseek-reasoner`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, and `deepseek-v4-pro`.

## 0.1.8 (2026-06-30)

### Fixes

#### Blaxel sandbox runner with pause, resume, detach, and rejoin

Replace the placeholder Blaxel runner passthrough with a first-party Blaxel
Sandboxes provider that drives the real control-plane (`/sandboxes`) and
per-sandbox (process/filesystem/preview) REST APIs.

The remote-runner contract gains optional, defaulted lifecycle support so a
runner-bound thread can pause its sandbox toward standby, resume it, fully
detach (releasing the local session while keeping the sandbox alive), and
rejoin the same sandbox from persisted thread state — including across a
process restart, with no orphan sandbox creation. New `RunnerCapabilities`
flags (`pausable`, `detachable`) and `RemoteRunnerSession`/`RemoteRunnerProvider`
methods (`pause`, `resume`, `detach`, `rejoin_session`) default to no-op/false so
existing providers are unchanged.

Exposed through new app-server JSON-RPC methods (`runners/pause`,
`runners/resume`, `runners/detach`, `runners/rejoin`) and a `roder runners` CLI.
The Blaxel credential is sourced from the environment (`BLAXEL_API_KEY` /
`BL_API_KEY`, with `BL_WORKSPACE`) and never written to session state.

A selected runner now actually routes coding tools into the sandbox: a
runtime-level destination (TUI runner picker or config `default_destination`)
auto-binds new threads when the provider advertises a default workspace via the
new `RemoteRunnerProvider::default_workspace` (Blaxel opts in; other providers
are unchanged). Verified live end to end against a real Blaxel account: TUI
shell/file tools execute inside an Alpine sandbox, and pause/resume/detach/rejoin
work through the CLI.

## 0.1.7 (2026-06-27)

### Fixes

#### Let the Claude Code provider use the "Claude in Chrome" browser tools

The `claude-code` provider can now register against the local Claude Code
"Claude in Chrome" (CFC) integration so the model can drive the user's real
browser through the CLI's `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

When enabled, the provider spawns `claude` with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_CFC=1` (so
the CLI wires its browser MCP server even in the SDK's headless/streaming mode)
and blanks `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for that child so the CLI
uses claude.ai subscription auth — a prerequisite for the Chrome integration to
connect. It pre-authorizes the browser tools through the SDK `can_use_tool`
callback (all other unmapped CLI tools stay denied) and surfaces the
CLI-executed browser tool calls as hosted tool calls
(`HostedToolCallStarted`/`HostedToolCallCompleted`) so they show in the UI
without the runtime trying to re-run a tool it never registered.

Enablement resolves from `ClaudeCodeConfig::enable_claude_in_chrome`, then the
`RODER_CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_CHROME`/`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_CHROME` env vars, then
auto-detection of a paired/enabled Chrome extension in the local Claude Code
config. No `claude-agent-sdk` change was required.

## 0.1.6 (2026-06-26)

### Features

#### Agent-swarm mode

Add a Roder-native `agent_swarm` fanout tool and `/agent-swarm` (alias `/swarm`)
commands (roadmap phase 104). A lead model can launch many homogeneous
subagent tasks from one `prompt_template` (with the `{{item}}` placeholder) over
an `items` array, optionally resuming existing agents via `resume_agent_ids`,
and receives an ordered `<agent_swarm_result>` summary with completed/failed/
aborted counts and resumable agent ids. A bounded scheduler paces launches
(initial burst then one per interval), honors an optional concurrency cap,
preserves input order, and supports cooperative cancellation. Configure via
`[agent_swarm]` or `RODER_AGENT_SWARM_*` env. The `/agent-swarm on|off|status`
command toggles a persistent swarm reminder; `/agent-swarm <prompt>` runs one
swarm task.

## 0.1.5 (2026-06-25)

### Fixes

#### Render an interactive selection dialog for `request_user_input`

The TUI previously only logged a system line when the model called the
interactive `request_user_input` survey tool, so the question and its options
were never shown and the blocked turn appeared to hang. The TUI now opens a
modal selection dialog listing each option with its description, lets you
navigate with the arrow keys (or `Ctrl+J`/`Ctrl+K`), jump with number keys
`1`-`9`, confirm with `Enter`, and skip with `Esc`. Confirming sends
`thread/resolve_user_input` with the chosen option label keyed by question id;
multi-question surveys are answered one at a time and accumulated before
resolving. The turn timer pauses while the dialog is open and resumes once it is
resolved, and a survey with no answerable options resolves immediately so the
turn never hangs.

The local mock inference provider now also drives `request_user_input` when a
user message contains `FAKE_REQUEST_USER_INPUT`, so the selection dialog can be
exercised end to end without a live provider.

## 0.1.4 (2026-06-24)

### Features

#### Manage external web-search providers from the TUI

Extend the "Web search provider" settings submenu to list the external provider
router options (firecrawl, tavily, perplexity, parallel, synthetic) alongside
the hosted modes, showing each provider's enabled and API-key-configured status
and the active selection. Selecting an external provider persists
`[web_search] mode = "external"`, the chosen `provider`, and enables that
provider's sub-section in user config (applies on restart).

The same hosted modes and external providers are also selectable from the
`Ctrl+P` command palette, and both the menu and palette fall back to reading
providers directly from user config when app-server settings are unavailable.

`settings/get` and `settings/set_web_search` now report the external-router
snapshot via `WebSearchSettings { external_enabled, external_provider, providers }`
and accept an optional `external_provider` selection. New `roder-config`
helpers (`save_web_search_external_provider`, `WebSearchConfig::provider_configured`,
`WebSearchConfig::router_snapshot`, `web_search_router_snapshot`) back the
persistence, status checks, and config-only fallback.

Synthetic web search now auto-configures from the synthetic inference provider:
because both share `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`, pasting the synthetic provider key
(`providers/configure`) makes the synthetic search provider report as
`key configured`, enables its `[web_search.synthetic]` sub-section, and lets it
resolve the borrowed key at runtime — no separate web-search key entry needed.

## 0.1.3 (2026-06-22)

### Features

#### Add first-party Synthetic inference provider

Adds the `synthetic` provider using Synthetic's OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions API. The provider ships built-in `syn:` model aliases
(`syn:large:text` default, plus `syn:small:text`, `syn:large:vision`,
`syn:small:vision`), preserves concrete `hf:{owner}/{model}` ids across config,
discovery, and selection, and resolves credentials only from
`SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`/`RODER_SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` or `[providers.synthetic]`. The
provider is visible without credentials so app-server and TUI can show setup
state, and turn-time inference fails locally with setup guidance when the key
is missing. The TUI provider menu points to the Synthetic dashboard for API-key
setup instead of the generic fallback URL.

### Fixes

- Stabilize Roder startup, streaming responses, and provider behavior

## 0.1.2 (2026-06-16)

### Features

#### Fireworks AI inference provider

Add the first-party `fireworks` inference provider with account-scoped model ids, Fireworks-specific API-key configuration, OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, offline model metadata, model discovery, and app-server provider-list coverage.

### Fixes

#### Added first-class `kimi-code` (aliases: `kimi`, `moonshot`) inference provider and `roder-ext-kimi-code` crate.

- Kimi Code subscription OAuth uses the managed API (`api.kimi.com/coding/v1`) with Kimi device headers and `kimi-code-cli` User-Agent; API keys still use Moonshot Open Platform (`api.moonshot.ai/v1`).
- Catalog entry + `kimi-for-coding` model (K2.7 Code).
- Device OAuth against `auth.kimi.com` with `roder auth login kimi-code`, TUI/app-server `auth/kimi-code/*`, and token storage under `~/.roder/auth/kimi-code.json`.
- API key fallback via env/config (`KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`, `RODER_KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`).
- Registered via extension host (always available, like SuperGrok).
- Docs: `docs/roder-kimi-code-provider.md`.
- Live smoke test added (opt-in via `RODER_KIMI_CODE_LIVE=1`).

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-15)

### Features

#### First-party image generation providers (OpenAI GPT Image and Google Gemini Nano Banana)

Provider-neutral image generation through the core media API: an image-capable
`MediaGenerationRequest`/multi-output `MediaGenerationResponse` contract, a new
`ProvidedService::MediaGenerator` extension service, a runtime media generation
service backing the canonical `media_generate_image` tool with a deterministic
offline fallback, new `roder-ext-openai-images` (`gpt-image-2` plus legacy ids)
and `roder-ext-google-images` (Nano Banana 2/Pro/base) provider crates,
`[media.image_generation]` config, `media/image/providers/list` and
`media/image/generate` app-server methods, `roder media` CLI commands, palette
entries, and regenerated schemas/SDK stubs. Live provider smokes stay opt-in
behind `RODER_OPENAI_IMAGE_LIVE` / `RODER_GEMINI_IMAGE_LIVE`.

### Fixes

#### Package-specific registry READMEs

Add package-specific README files for every Cargo crate, ensure npm and PyPI package READMEs link to roder.sh, and tighten the registry README verifier to require package-local documentation.

#### Registry README metadata and publish checklists

Ensure Cargo crates inherit the workspace README, document npm and PyPI publishing steps in package READMEs, and add a registry README verifier for future publishes.
