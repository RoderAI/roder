## 0.1.15 (2026-07-21)

### Fixes

#### Fix OpenCode DeepSeek multi-step tool rollouts

Refresh the OpenCode Zen model catalog (drop disabled free DeepSeek IDs, add
current free models and paid `deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-pro`), coalesce
parallel tool calls into valid chat-completions histories for longer DeepSeek
rollouts, and surface clearer OpenCode ModelError/CreditsError messages.

## 0.1.14 (2026-07-21)

### Fixes

#### Hosted browser authentication and request policy seams

Allow hosted deployments to resolve external bearer credentials into dynamic
tenant contexts, authenticate browser WebSockets through the
`roder.remote.v1` subprotocol, and apply a deployment request policy that can
rewrite or deny JSON-RPC calls before dispatch. Hosted health probes remain
unauthenticated for deployment schedulers.

Open hosted sockets now revalidate their bearer before every request and on a
bounded timer while idle, so external credential expiry and service-account
revocation stop request dispatch and notification delivery without waiting for
the client to reconnect or send another message. The gateway periodically
evicts idle tenant runtimes and stops that lifecycle loop during shutdown.

Externally resolved tenant ids now map to collision-resistant data directories;
existing lowercase slug tenant directories retain their original paths.

`turn/start` can now refresh a thread's volatile MCP bearer token without
persisting the credential in thread metadata.

## 0.1.13 (2026-07-21)

### Features

#### Eval loop persistence: continue past tool-failure limit and nudge on empty finalization

Adds two `[reliability]` knobs so eval-style runs keep working instead of
finalizing early:

- `continue_on_failure_limit` (default `false`): when a turn hits
  `max_consecutive_tool_failures`, reset the consecutive-failure counter, nudge
  the model to keep going, and continue the round loop instead of stopping.
  Bounded by `max_tool_failures_per_turn`, `max_model_calls_per_turn`, and the
  per-turn tool-round cap.
- `empty_tool_call_nudges` (default `0`): number of times a non-interactive/eval
  turn is nudged to verify completeness when the model returns a final message
  with no tool calls, before genuinely ending the turn.

Both default to the safe (off) behavior for interactive and plain
non-interactive runs; the `eval` runtime profile enables them by default
(`continue_on_failure_limit = true`, `empty_tool_call_nudges = 1`), and explicit
`[reliability]` config keys still override the profile defaults. Also strengthens
the eval-profile persistence instructions to keep working until the task is fully
solved and verified.

#### Add bounded lifecycle recovery, cleanup proof, and shutdown diagnostics

Roder now persists redacted per-turn lifecycle records, reconciles interrupted
turns after restart, and reports bounded cleanup ownership rather than treating
an aborted runtime task as proof that provider work was reaped. Local process
tasks drain through graceful signal, forced kill, and reap; remote tasks use the
remote runner cancellation API; and the Claude Code provider uses a vendored SDK
cleanup path with offline real-child regression coverage.

The app-server adds lifecycle notifications, `runtime/drain`, and
`lifecycle/metrics`; the CLI and TUI expose durable recovery state. A shared
`[lifecycle]` configuration controls shutdown budgets, task policy, bounded
process diagnostics, and compatible legacy shutdown fallbacks.

## 0.1.12 (2026-07-10)

### Fixes

#### Match Codex V2 Ultra agent lifecycle semantics

#### Added

- Added Codex V2-style canonical agent trees, full/empty/last-N context forks,
  nested agents, reusable follow-up turns, mailbox-aware waiting, and
  non-destructive interruption.
- Added exact parent model, provider, Ultra reasoning, workspace, policy, tool,
  runner, and live developer-context inheritance for spawned agents.
- Added full `team/started`, `team/member/started`, and terminal result details
  to the app-server protocol.

#### Changed

- `send_message` now queues coordination without starting an idle agent, while
  `followup_task` starts or steers the existing canonical agent thread.
- Child final results and terminal errors are delivered automatically to their
  direct parent, and completed identities remain available for later work.
- Inter-agent delivery now uses typed `MESSAGE`, `NEW_TASK`, and `FINAL_ANSWER`
  envelopes with canonical sender and recipient paths.

#### Fixed

- Fixed spawn-capacity, completion/follow-up, interruption, mailbox batching,
  acknowledgement, restart, and wait races found by comparison with Codex V2
  and Claude Code agent workflows.
- Prevented full-history children from replaying parent orchestration by making
  the newest `NEW_TASK` payload the authoritative child assignment.
- Preserved spawn-time live instructions, developer context, and model
  selection across reusable follow-up turns.
- Prevented interrupted-turn mailbox reservations from stranding queued
  messages or accepting stale delivery acknowledgements.
- Bounded recursive agent paths to five levels below `/root`, rejecting deeper
  spawns before creating team or thread state.

## 0.1.11 (2026-07-09)

### Fixes

#### Add GPT-5.6 Codex models and Ultra mode

Expose GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna plus GPT-5.4 in the OpenAI and Codex
catalogs, with the current context windows, defaults, and reasoning-effort
menus. Make Sol the default Codex model.

Keep Ultra as a first-class Roder effort for Sol and Terra while mapping it to
the provider's `max` wire effort. Ultra enables proactive, bounded multi-agent
delegation; lower Sol and Terra efforts remain explicit-request-only.

## 0.1.10 (2026-07-09)

### Fixes

#### Add Grok 4.5 to xAI and SuperGrok providers

Expose `grok-4.5` (500k context, default high reasoning, low/medium/high) as the
default model for both the `xai` API-key provider and SuperGrok OAuth. Keep
legacy Grok 4.3 / 4.20 and SuperGrok Build/Composer entries selectable.

## 0.1.9 (2026-07-07)

### Fixes

#### Make provider browser auth robust on WSL and add Kimi Code API key login

Print auth URLs before opening browsers, fall back to WSL-friendly browser commands, and allow `roder auth login kimi-code --api-key [KEY]`.

## 0.1.8 (2026-06-30)

### Fixes

#### Dependency refresh and runner lifecycle method manifest

Register the `runners/pause`, `runners/resume`, `runners/detach`, and
`runners/rejoin` methods in the app-server method manifest and regenerate the
checked-in JSON schema and the TypeScript/Python generated client types so they
expose the runner lifecycle surface.

Refresh dependencies across the workspace and SDKs after validating each change:

- Rust: semver-compatible lockfile updates plus major bumps of `which`
  (6 -> 8), `tokio-tungstenite` (0.28 -> 0.29), `rcgen` (0.13 -> 0.14),
  `rusqlite` (0.38 -> 0.40), and `sqlx` (0.8 -> 0.9). Fixed a `time` 0.3.52
  deprecation (`format_description::parse` -> `parse_borrowed`). The
  `agent-client-protocol-schema` 1.x major is deferred because it renames the
  ACP type surface and needs a dedicated ACP-compliance migration.
- TypeScript/edit-tools: bump `@types/node` to v26.
- Python SDK: refresh the uv lock (anyio, pytest, pyright, idna).

## 0.1.7 (2026-06-30)

### Features

#### Blaxel sandbox runner with pause, resume, detach, and rejoin

Replace the placeholder Blaxel runner passthrough with a first-party Blaxel
Sandboxes provider that drives the real control-plane (`/sandboxes`) and
per-sandbox (process/filesystem/preview) REST APIs.

The remote-runner contract gains optional, defaulted lifecycle support so a
runner-bound thread can pause its sandbox toward standby, resume it, fully
detach (releasing the local session while keeping the sandbox alive), and
rejoin the same sandbox from persisted thread state — including across a
process restart, with no orphan sandbox creation. New `RunnerCapabilities`
flags (`pausable`, `detachable`) and `RemoteRunnerSession`/`RemoteRunnerProvider`
methods (`pause`, `resume`, `detach`, `rejoin_session`) default to no-op/false so
existing providers are unchanged.

Exposed through new app-server JSON-RPC methods (`runners/pause`,
`runners/resume`, `runners/detach`, `runners/rejoin`) and a `roder runners` CLI.
The Blaxel credential is sourced from the environment (`BLAXEL_API_KEY` /
`BL_API_KEY`, with `BL_WORKSPACE`) and never written to session state.

A selected runner now actually routes coding tools into the sandbox: a
runtime-level destination (TUI runner picker or config `default_destination`)
auto-binds new threads when the provider advertises a default workspace via the
new `RemoteRunnerProvider::default_workspace` (Blaxel opts in; other providers
are unchanged). Verified live end to end against a real Blaxel account: TUI
shell/file tools execute inside an Alpine sandbox, and pause/resume/detach/rejoin
work through the CLI.

## 0.1.6 (2026-06-26)

### Features

#### Agent-swarm mode

Add a Roder-native `agent_swarm` fanout tool and `/agent-swarm` (alias `/swarm`)
commands (roadmap phase 104). A lead model can launch many homogeneous
subagent tasks from one `prompt_template` (with the `{{item}}` placeholder) over
an `items` array, optionally resuming existing agents via `resume_agent_ids`,
and receives an ordered `<agent_swarm_result>` summary with completed/failed/
aborted counts and resumable agent ids. A bounded scheduler paces launches
(initial burst then one per interval), honors an optional concurrency cap,
preserves input order, and supports cooperative cancellation. Configure via
`[agent_swarm]` or `RODER_AGENT_SWARM_*` env. The `/agent-swarm on|off|status`
command toggles a persistent swarm reminder; `/agent-swarm <prompt>` runs one
swarm task.

### Fixes

#### Server-side agent-swarm mode

Move agent-swarm mode from TUI-only client state to runtime/app-server state so
every client benefits (roadmap 104). Adds the `thread/set_agent_swarm_mode`
app-server method, an `agentSwarmMode` field on `settings/get`, and an
`AgentSwarmModeChanged` event. When swarm mode is active the runtime injects the
canonical swarm reminder into each turn's developer instructions
(`Runtime::set_agent_swarm_mode` + `apply_agent_swarm_mode`), so the model is
nudged toward the `agent_swarm` fanout tool regardless of which client drove the
turn. The TUI now toggles swarm mode through the method and no longer prepends
the reminder client-side. Also fixes two pre-existing method-manifest ordering
issues (`auth/kimi-code/*`, `thread/compact`).

## 0.1.5 (2026-06-26)

### Fixes

#### Fix needing a second Ctrl+C to exit a live Claude Code session

Interrupt any in-flight turn during TUI teardown and exit the process cleanly
once the terminal is restored, so a single Ctrl+C fully exits even when an
in-process provider (e.g. Claude Code) has spawned a CLI subprocess whose
runtime tasks would otherwise block shutdown.

## 0.1.4 (2026-06-24)

### Features

#### Manage external web-search providers from the TUI

Extend the "Web search provider" settings submenu to list the external provider
router options (firecrawl, tavily, perplexity, parallel, synthetic) alongside
the hosted modes, showing each provider's enabled and API-key-configured status
and the active selection. Selecting an external provider persists
`[web_search] mode = "external"`, the chosen `provider`, and enables that
provider's sub-section in user config (applies on restart).

The same hosted modes and external providers are also selectable from the
`Ctrl+P` command palette, and both the menu and palette fall back to reading
providers directly from user config when app-server settings are unavailable.

`settings/get` and `settings/set_web_search` now report the external-router
snapshot via `WebSearchSettings { external_enabled, external_provider, providers }`
and accept an optional `external_provider` selection. New `roder-config`
helpers (`save_web_search_external_provider`, `WebSearchConfig::provider_configured`,
`WebSearchConfig::router_snapshot`, `web_search_router_snapshot`) back the
persistence, status checks, and config-only fallback.

Synthetic web search now auto-configures from the synthetic inference provider:
because both share `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`, pasting the synthetic provider key
(`providers/configure`) makes the synthetic search provider report as
`key configured`, enables its `[web_search.synthetic]` sub-section, and lets it
resolve the borrowed key at runtime — no separate web-search key entry needed.

## 0.1.3 (2026-06-22)

### Features

#### Add first-party Synthetic inference provider

Adds the `synthetic` provider using Synthetic's OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions API. The provider ships built-in `syn:` model aliases
(`syn:large:text` default, plus `syn:small:text`, `syn:large:vision`,
`syn:small:vision`), preserves concrete `hf:{owner}/{model}` ids across config,
discovery, and selection, and resolves credentials only from
`SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`/`RODER_SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` or `[providers.synthetic]`. The
provider is visible without credentials so app-server and TUI can show setup
state, and turn-time inference fails locally with setup guidance when the key
is missing. The TUI provider menu points to the Synthetic dashboard for API-key
setup instead of the generic fallback URL.

### Fixes

- Stabilize Roder startup, streaming responses, and provider behavior

## 0.1.2 (2026-06-16)

### Features

#### Fireworks AI inference provider

Add the first-party `fireworks` inference provider with account-scoped model ids, Fireworks-specific API-key configuration, OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, offline model metadata, model discovery, and app-server provider-list coverage.

### Fixes

#### Added first-class `kimi-code` (aliases: `kimi`, `moonshot`) inference provider and `roder-ext-kimi-code` crate.

- Kimi Code subscription OAuth uses the managed API (`api.kimi.com/coding/v1`) with Kimi device headers and `kimi-code-cli` User-Agent; API keys still use Moonshot Open Platform (`api.moonshot.ai/v1`).
- Catalog entry + `kimi-for-coding` model (K2.7 Code).
- Device OAuth against `auth.kimi.com` with `roder auth login kimi-code`, TUI/app-server `auth/kimi-code/*`, and token storage under `~/.roder/auth/kimi-code.json`.
- API key fallback via env/config (`KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`, `RODER_KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`).
- Registered via extension host (always available, like SuperGrok).
- Docs: `docs/roder-kimi-code-provider.md`.
- Live smoke test added (opt-in via `RODER_KIMI_CODE_LIVE=1`).

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-15)

### Features

#### First-party image generation providers (OpenAI GPT Image and Google Gemini Nano Banana)

Provider-neutral image generation through the core media API: an image-capable
`MediaGenerationRequest`/multi-output `MediaGenerationResponse` contract, a new
`ProvidedService::MediaGenerator` extension service, a runtime media generation
service backing the canonical `media_generate_image` tool with a deterministic
offline fallback, new `roder-ext-openai-images` (`gpt-image-2` plus legacy ids)
and `roder-ext-google-images` (Nano Banana 2/Pro/base) provider crates,
`[media.image_generation]` config, `media/image/providers/list` and
`media/image/generate` app-server methods, `roder media` CLI commands, palette
entries, and regenerated schemas/SDK stubs. Live provider smokes stay opt-in
behind `RODER_OPENAI_IMAGE_LIVE` / `RODER_GEMINI_IMAGE_LIVE`.

#### One-command Roder package install (`roder install npm:/git:/path`)

Roder packages bundle process extensions, skills, slash commands, and themes
behind a root `roder.toml` manifest. Install from npm, git (shorthand, SSH,
raw URLs, pinned refs), or local paths; manage with `roder packages
list|resources|enable|disable|approve|filter|sync|init`, `roder remove`,
`roder update`, and ephemeral `-e` loading. Resources surface through the
existing skills/commands/theme registries; the process-extension protocol
gains manifest-declared tool providers served over `tools/call`. New
app-server `packages/*` methods, a `/packages` builtin, and a Packages
palette section round out the surfaces. npm lifecycle scripts stay disabled
unless `--allow-scripts` is passed, and package process extensions never
launch before explicit approval.

### Fixes

- Add a stdio Agent Client Protocol v1 adapter backed by the Roder app-server runtime.

#### Package-specific registry READMEs

Add package-specific README files for every Cargo crate, ensure npm and PyPI package READMEs link to roder.sh, and tighten the registry README verifier to require package-local documentation.

#### Registry README metadata and publish checklists

Ensure Cargo crates inherit the workspace README, document npm and PyPI publishing steps in package READMEs, and add a registry README verifier for future publishes.
