# roder-codex-auth

`roder-codex-auth` is the Codex authentication support for [Roder](https://roder.sh).

## What It Does

It manages Codex sign-in, token storage, status, and logout flows used by the Roder CLI and providers.

## How It Fits Into Roder

Roder is an agentic software development system with a Rust CLI/TUI, a JSON-RPC app-server, SDKs, package resources, and first-party runtime extensions. This package is released as part of that workspace so downstream users can depend on the same component boundaries that Roder itself uses.
