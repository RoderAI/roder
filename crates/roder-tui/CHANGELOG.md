## 0.1.3 (2026-06-22)

### Features

#### Show full provider error response body in the timeline detail popup

Chat Completions provider errors (e.g. Synthetic 502 Bad Gateway) previously
discarded the response body entirely and showed only a generic hint like
"provider server error; response body redacted". Now the error includes the
full response body after a separator, so clicking the error row (or pressing
Enter on it) opens the existing tool-detail popup with the complete provider
response text — the same popup used for shell output and file edits.

The auth credential (bearer token or api-key header value) is scrubbed from
the body before it enters the error message, so the popup is safe to share.
Bodies are capped at 4 KB to avoid unbounded error messages.

The TUI also makes `Error` timeline items selectable and clickable, routes
Enter on a selected error row to the detail modal, and renders the popup with
an "error details" title and "Response body" label when the source is a
provider error rather than a shell command.

### Fixes

- Stabilize Roder startup, streaming responses, and provider behavior

#### Add first-party Synthetic inference provider

Adds the `synthetic` provider using Synthetic's OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions API. The provider ships built-in `syn:` model aliases
(`syn:large:text` default, plus `syn:small:text`, `syn:large:vision`,
`syn:small:vision`), preserves concrete `hf:{owner}/{model}` ids across config,
discovery, and selection, and resolves credentials only from
`SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`/`RODER_SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` or `[providers.synthetic]`. The
provider is visible without credentials so app-server and TUI can show setup
state, and turn-time inference fails locally with setup guidance when the key
is missing. The TUI provider menu points to the Synthetic dashboard for API-key
setup instead of the generic fallback URL.

## 0.1.2 (2026-06-16)

### Fixes

- Improve context compaction across phases 2–4: prune old tool outputs before full compaction, add LLM state-snapshot summarization with verify/reject, hysteresis coalescing, `/compact` via `thread/compact`, `context.compaction_skipped` metrics, and a Grok-style loop regression fixture. Phase 1 fixes remain: compaction boundary on load, once-per-turn guard, ProviderMetadata exclusion from token estimates, and suffix retention from the last user message.

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-15)

### Features

#### One-command Roder package install (`roder install npm:/git:/path`)

Roder packages bundle process extensions, skills, slash commands, and themes
behind a root `roder.toml` manifest. Install from npm, git (shorthand, SSH,
raw URLs, pinned refs), or local paths; manage with `roder packages
list|resources|enable|disable|approve|filter|sync|init`, `roder remove`,
`roder update`, and ephemeral `-e` loading. Resources surface through the
existing skills/commands/theme registries; the process-extension protocol
gains manifest-declared tool providers served over `tools/call`. New
app-server `packages/*` methods, a `/packages` builtin, and a Packages
palette section round out the surfaces. npm lifecycle scripts stay disabled
unless `--allow-scripts` is passed, and package process extensions never
launch before explicit approval.

#### Roadmap orchestration dashboard and multi-worker fan-out

Redesign the roadmap TUI workspace as an orchestration dashboard with progress
header, status strip, tree-style worker rows, and windowed scrolling. Add
orchestrator prompt rules in `roder-roadmap` and fan-out controls in the TUI:
`S` spawns up to eight workers across ready tasks and `s` spawns one for the
focused task.

### Fixes

- Put Models first in the Ctrl+P menu

#### First-party image generation providers (OpenAI GPT Image and Google Gemini Nano Banana)

Provider-neutral image generation through the core media API: an image-capable
`MediaGenerationRequest`/multi-output `MediaGenerationResponse` contract, a new
`ProvidedService::MediaGenerator` extension service, a runtime media generation
service backing the canonical `media_generate_image` tool with a deterministic
offline fallback, new `roder-ext-openai-images` (`gpt-image-2` plus legacy ids)
and `roder-ext-google-images` (Nano Banana 2/Pro/base) provider crates,
`[media.image_generation]` config, `media/image/providers/list` and
`media/image/generate` app-server methods, `roder media` CLI commands, palette
entries, and regenerated schemas/SDK stubs. Live provider smokes stay opt-in
behind `RODER_OPENAI_IMAGE_LIVE` / `RODER_GEMINI_IMAGE_LIVE`.

#### Package-specific registry READMEs

Add package-specific README files for every Cargo crate, ensure npm and PyPI package READMEs link to roder.sh, and tighten the registry README verifier to require package-local documentation.

#### Registry README metadata and publish checklists

Ensure Cargo crates inherit the workspace README, document npm and PyPI publishing steps in package READMEs, and add a registry README verifier for future publishes.
