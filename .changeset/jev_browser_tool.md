# Add Jev Ultrafast as a browser tool provider

Expose a bounded `jev_browse` tool backed by the upstream Jev CDP agent, with
Roder policy approval and a provider-configured `JEV_API_KEY`.

Roder resolves the Chrome DevTools endpoint itself: it reuses one that is
already listening and otherwise starts a visible Chrome on its own profile, so a
browser task no longer fails because nothing debuggable is running. Tasks run in
a foreground tab by default (`foreground: false` for a background tab), and the
typing helper is served from Roder's own harness — the calling turn's model when
it speaks chat-completions, otherwise the first configured chat-completions
provider — instead of requiring an OpenRouter key.

Results now carry `observed_elements` and, when upstream aborts at its action or
model-call budget, `stopped_because` plus the trace collected so far instead of
a bare traceback. A blocked run explains what Jev can target, so a caller can
choose another page rather than substituting a local one. `wait` actions hold
the page for `JEV_WAIT_MS` (default 800ms) rather than upstream's 100ms, and the
text helper's reasoning field follows the provider's accepted shape.

Jev is now a Rust port that runs inside the Roder binary — the agent loop,
action space, decision contract, text helper and a direct CDP client — with
upstream's in-page scripts vendored verbatim. Browser tasks need no Python, no
`uv` and no `browser_harness` daemon. Fixtures recorded from the upstream Python
pin the port's behaviour: the decision request body matches byte for byte, the
observation fingerprint matches hash for hash, and every documented validation
verdict agrees.
