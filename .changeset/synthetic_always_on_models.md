# Show full provider error response body in the timeline detail popup

Chat Completions provider errors (e.g. Synthetic 502 Bad Gateway) previously
discarded the response body entirely and showed only a generic hint like
"provider server error; response body redacted". Now the error includes the
full response body after a separator, so clicking the error row (or pressing
Enter on it) opens the existing tool-detail popup with the complete provider
response text — the same popup used for shell output and file edits.

The auth credential (bearer token or api-key header value) is scrubbed from
the body before it enters the error message, so the popup is safe to share.
Bodies are capped at 4 KB to avoid unbounded error messages.

The TUI also makes `Error` timeline items selectable and clickable, routes
Enter on a selected error row to the detail modal, and renders the popup with
an "error details" title and "Response body" label when the source is a
provider error rather than a shell command.
