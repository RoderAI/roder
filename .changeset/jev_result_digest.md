# Jev results show the page, and Jev reports access blocks and reads widget frames

The model only ever reads a tool result's text, and `jev_browse` used to give
it one line ("done at <url> (3 actions)"). The text is now a bounded digest
of the call, at most 8,000 characters and 120 lines:

- A header with the status, the session call and tab, today's date, time and
  time zone, the page's address, title and HTTP status (marked
  page-supplied), the outcome and what to do next. After `done` the caller is
  told to check the page against the goal, how to continue with `url ""`, and
  not to sign in, reserve, pay or send personal details unless the user asked.
- The session's tabs, totals and earlier calls.
- Between marker lines that say it is untrusted: why Jev stopped, each step
  with the section its control sat in and its effect, the text of frames Jev
  read, the headings, the page text, and the options Jev can act on, grouped
  by the card or section they sit in.

The result's data gains `controls`, `page` (`http_status`, `headings`,
`frames`) and each step's `effect` and `context`. `JevActionRecord` gains a
`context` field; `JevControl`, `JevPageFacts` and `JevFrameText` are new
public types, and `JevBrowser` gains a default `describe` method.
`JEV_SESSION_LOG=<dir>` appends one JSON line per call for grading.

Jev also looks before it decides:

- A site that refuses automated access (HTTP 401, 403 or 429 with a refusal
  page, a challenge address, or an "Access Denied" page with nothing to act
  on) ends the call with the new status `access_denied` before any decision,
  with the evidence. Jev only reports it and never tries to get around it.
- A first observation that shows nothing yet is read again for up to about
  2.6 s, and a BLOCKED about a blank page is checked once, at no decision's
  cost.
- The text of up to two large, visible frames of another origin (a booking
  widget) is read into the page text and the result; their controls are not
  offered. `JEV_FRAME_TEXT=0` turns this off.
