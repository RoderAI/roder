# When Jev cannot progress, Roder's full browser tools go on in the same tab

Jev acts only on the controls its snapshot offers, with a small action
vocabulary. When a run ends because of that (the model answered BLOCKED,
three steps changed nothing, its targets stayed covered, the page offered
nothing Jev can act on, or its budget ran out), Roder now falls back to its
own direct CDP tools on the same tab, with its cookies and page state, as
`JEV_FALLBACK` says:

- `auto` (default): `jev_browse` runs a bounded loop driven by the session's
  model (or `JEV_FALLBACK_MODEL`, at `JEV_FALLBACK_REASONING`, default low)
  with look, screenshot, click at a ref or x/y, hover, drag, type, any key,
  scroll, select, navigate and wait, and returns one result: the call's end
  state, Jev's own status as `jev_status`, and `drivers` with each driver's
  steps, model calls, time and tokens. `JEV_FALLBACK_MAX_STEPS`,
  `JEV_FALLBACK_MAX_SECONDS` and `JEV_FALLBACK_MAX_TOKENS` bound it.
- `handover`: the result tells the caller the full tools work on this same
  tab, names them (`jev_tab_*`) and the tab, and says where Jev stopped.
  `auto` hands over too when no model can drive it or it also fails.
- `off`: Jev's result as before.

It never runs after `needs_input`, `needs_confirmation`, `access_denied` or a
page that did not load, and it inherits Jev's rules: the allowed origins, the
irreversible-action gate (stricter, with no model to clear a shortlisted
control, and stopping any press into another site's frame), approvals and
policy modes, cookie banners refused but never accepted (untouched with
refusal off), a covered control never pressed (by a click or by Enter or
Space while it has focus), secrets never read and reported as `[secret]`,
screenshots with filled secret fields blacked out and withheld while a typed
secret shows, and page content marked untrusted.

The `jev_tab_*` tools are registered with `jev_browse` and drive only the
thread's Jev tab, under the session's lock. `roder-ext-chrome` makes its
direct CDP toolset public as `roder_ext_chrome::direct` (a `DirectSession` on
a tab by endpoint and target id, a `DirectGuard` for the owner's rules,
`direct_tools` to bind it as model-facing tools, and the shared `devtools`
helpers Jev's own connection now uses); Roder Desktop's integrated browser
fallback goes through the same client and gains a screenshot.

Jev also uncovers a covered target before giving up: Escape, the covering
layer's own close control, or a press outside it, then the action goes ahead
in the same step. Escape and Enter are sent without a native key code, which
on macOS made Escape open Chrome's "About Chrome" page from a shown tab.

Breaking: `JevExtension` is a struct (`JevExtension::new()`,
`with_inference_engines`); `JevToolContributor::new(engines)`;
`JevActOutcome` and `JevActionRecord` gain `uncovered`; `JevRunResult` gains
`stop_cause` (the new `JevStopCause`).
