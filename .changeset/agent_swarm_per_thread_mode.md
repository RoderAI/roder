# Per-thread agent-swarm mode

Scope agent-swarm mode to a single thread instead of the whole runtime (roadmap
104 follow-up), so toggling swarm mode on one thread no longer leaks the swarm
reminder into other threads sharing the runtime — aligning swarm mode with the
per-thread `thread/*` contract.

The runtime keeps a per-thread override map alongside the global default
(mirroring the team per-member policy-mode idiom): `set_agent_swarm_mode_for_thread`
stores the override and emits `AgentSwarmModeChanged` with the real `thread_id`,
and `effective_agent_swarm_mode_for_thread` resolves the per-thread override or
falls back to the runtime-global default; the turn loop now consults it. The
`thread/set_agent_swarm_mode` app-server method gains an optional `threadId`
(present -> per-thread, absent -> global, preserving legacy behavior) echoed back
in the result, and the TUI passes its current thread id. `settings/get` continues
to expose the global default. Covered by runtime unit tests (per-thread
isolation, off-override-wins, real-thread-id event) and an app-server e2e test.
