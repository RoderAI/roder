# Blaxel sandbox runner with pause, resume, detach, and rejoin

Replace the placeholder Blaxel runner passthrough with a first-party Blaxel
Sandboxes provider that drives the real control-plane (`/sandboxes`) and
per-sandbox (process/filesystem/preview) REST APIs.

The remote-runner contract gains optional, defaulted lifecycle support so a
runner-bound thread can pause its sandbox toward standby, resume it, fully
detach (releasing the local session while keeping the sandbox alive), and
rejoin the same sandbox from persisted thread state — including across a
process restart, with no orphan sandbox creation. New `RunnerCapabilities`
flags (`pausable`, `detachable`) and `RemoteRunnerSession`/`RemoteRunnerProvider`
methods (`pause`, `resume`, `detach`, `rejoin_session`) default to no-op/false so
existing providers are unchanged.

Exposed through new app-server JSON-RPC methods (`runners/pause`,
`runners/resume`, `runners/detach`, `runners/rejoin`) and a `roder runners` CLI.
The Blaxel credential is sourced from the environment (`BLAXEL_API_KEY` /
`BL_API_KEY`, with `BL_WORKSPACE`) and never written to session state.

A selected runner now actually routes coding tools into the sandbox: a
runtime-level destination (TUI runner picker or config `default_destination`)
auto-binds new threads when the provider advertises a default workspace via the
new `RemoteRunnerProvider::default_workspace` (Blaxel opts in; other providers
are unchanged). Verified live end to end against a real Blaxel account: TUI
shell/file tools execute inside an Alpine sandbox, and pause/resume/detach/rejoin
work through the CLI.
