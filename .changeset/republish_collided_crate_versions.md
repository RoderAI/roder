# Publish today's content under fresh crate versions

`roder-api` 0.1.21, `roder-core` 0.1.19, `roder-app-server` 0.1.17,
`roder-evals` 0.1.2 and `roder-ext-openai-responses` 0.1.10 were published to
crates.io on 2026-09-23 from a branch that predates the Codex agent backend,
the Jev browser tool, the Chrome bridge work and the Grok 4.7 catalog entries.
crates.io versions are immutable, so those numbers cannot carry the current
code and the registry copies do not match the git tags of the same version.

Bump them so the released content reaches crates.io under versions that
describe it. `roder-ext-jev` and `roder-ext-codex-backend` are bumped with
them: both are new crates whose first publish must depend on a registry
`roder-api` that actually contains `roder_api::backend`, which the 0.1.21
registry copy does not.

Adds the package-local READMEs both new crates need to publish.
