# Server-side agent-swarm mode

Move agent-swarm mode from TUI-only client state to runtime/app-server state so
every client benefits (roadmap 104). Adds the `thread/set_agent_swarm_mode`
app-server method, an `agentSwarmMode` field on `settings/get`, and an
`AgentSwarmModeChanged` event. When swarm mode is active the runtime injects the
canonical swarm reminder into each turn's developer instructions
(`Runtime::set_agent_swarm_mode` + `apply_agent_swarm_mode`), so the model is
nudged toward the `agent_swarm` fanout tool regardless of which client drove the
turn. The TUI now toggles swarm mode through the method and no longer prepends
the reminder client-side. Also fixes two pre-existing method-manifest ordering
issues (`auth/kimi-code/*`, `thread/compact`).
